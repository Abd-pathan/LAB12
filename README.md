The goal is to create a structure and pass it as an argument to the thread creation function, avoiding the use of global variables. The structure should contain the variables a and sum of type double, N and size of type int, and tid of type long or int. Each thread should have its own instance of this structure.

Code Explanation:

In the code, a structure Pthread_Sum is defined to encapsulate the variables mentioned in the problem statement. pthread_mutex_t is also declared to ensure mutual exclusion while updating the shared variable sum.

The compute function is the routine executed by each thread. It takes a void* argument, which is cast to Pthread*. Each thread computes a partial sum of the array a, and the partial sums are accumulated in the shared variable sum using a mutex for synchronization.

In the main function, command-line arguments are parsed to get the number of elements N and the number of threads size. Memory is allocated for the array a, thread IDs (tid), and an array of Pthread structures (pt).

The program then initializes the array a, creates threads, computes partial sums in parallel, joins the threads, and prints the result. Each thread operates on a different portion of the array, and the partial sums are accumulated to get the final result.

In conclusion the program is encapsulating the shared variables in a structure and passing this structure as an argument to the threads.
